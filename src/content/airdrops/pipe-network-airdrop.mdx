## About Pipe Network

Pipe Network is a decentralized Content Delivery Network (CDN) built on Solana. It aims to offer a more efficient, cost-effective alternative to traditional CDN providers by utilizing blockchain technology and a network of distributed nodes.

With two main components—**Point of Presence (PoP) nodes** for content delivery and **Guardian Nodes** for network monitoring—Pipe Network ensures reliable performance and network integrity.
