## About Bless

Bless is the world’s first shared computer — a network of everyday devices supporting AI projects and high-demand computing tasks. This innovative platform puts key internet infrastructure back into the hands of regular people, enabling a circular internet economy. Unlike centralized data centers, Bless empowers users to support AI inference, data processing, and web hosting while earning rewards.

Bless has raised $8M in funding from prominent investors, including M31 Capital and NGC Ventures. The project is currently running a testnet campaign, offering users a chance to earn points (referred to as **time**) by participating actively. Users who accumulate time are likely to receive airdrops if a Bless token goes live.

## How to Participate

1. **Sign Up**
   - Visit the [Bless Registration Page](https://bless.network/dashboard?ref=8R9WAD) and submit your details.

2. **Install the Extension**
   - Install the Bless Chrome extension and log in.

3. **Run the Node**
   - Enable the testnet node through the extension.
   - Keep the node active to accumulate points in the form of time.

4. **Invite Friends**
   - Refer friends and earn 10% of the time they collect.
   - Maximize your rewards by inviting more participants.

## Potential Rewards

- Points are earned as **time** for running the testnet node.
- Accumulated points may lead to airdrops if the Bless token launches.

## Why Participate?

By joining Bless early, you’re positioning yourself for potential **retroactive airdrops**. Many projects reward early adopters with governance tokens or other incentives. Don’t miss this opportunity to be a part of the growing **decentralized computing ecosystem**.
